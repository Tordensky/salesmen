  <h2>INF-3201 Parallel Programming</h1>
  <h1>Assignment 2: Race Trap</h2>

  <h3>Story</h3>


  <p>Now that Wile has a dessert map, it is time to set a trap. The
  reasoning behind this trap is that if the RoadRunner is so fast,
  then it must need a lot of energy.  Thus a way of catching the
  RoadRunner is to lure it into spending more energy than it
  gains.</p>

  <p>Wile has bought a huge bag of corn from ACME. Using the excellent
  map that we have previously generated for Wile he will now attempt
  to place 15 portions of corn in a way so that the shortest possible
  path between all corn-portions is longer than the energy obtained
  from the corn allow the RoadRunner to traverse.</p>

  <p>The RoadRunner can run 200 km on each portion of corn, so now we
  need to calculate the minimum distance between the 15 portions that
  Willie has placed and see if this is longer than 3000 km, in which
  case Wile can eat.</p>

  <h3>The Assignment</h3>

  <p>Implement a parallel branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the
  Traveling Salesman Problem. You can base your algorithm on the
  sequential version given to you. Your code should use <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-cilk/"> Intel Cilk++ Software Development Kit</a>. 
  The code should be able to run on any number
  of CPUs, and the results must always be the same regardless of the
  number of CPUs used. If you want to implement another algorithm than
  the branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman
  Problem, you should contact us first.</p>

  <p>A report should be made that describes the various choices that
  has been made, as well as individual techniques that has been
  applied to improve performance. The performance impact of each the
  applied techniques should be documented. In addition, the
  scalability of your implementation and the achieved performance
  should be discussed. Use Cilkscreen Race Detector and Cilkview Scalability Analyzer in  <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-cilk/"> Intel Cilk++ Software Development Kit</a> to analyze your implementation.</p>

  <h3>Optimization</h3>

  <p>Any optimization may be applied, but the result should be correct
  (ie. give an reasonable answer) and independent of the number of
  nodes that are used to achieve the solution. 
  Any optimization that is applied must be thoroughly described.</p>


  <h4>Hand-in</h4>

	<p>You must follow the instructions given in the group session
	(slides available on fronter). If the requirements given there are
	not met, the hand-in will <i>not</i> be accepted.</p>
	
    <p>The deadline is Thursday, October 18th, 24:00</p>
